# All4Quant: The Pursuit of Alpha 📈

Welcome to **All4Quant**. This is a structured repository of my journey toward mastering Quantitative Finance and Algorithmic problem-solving. It serves as a living document of rigorous proofs, optimized code, and strategic intuition.

## 🎯 The Mission

The goal of this project is to consolidate the high-frequency knowledge required for top-tier Quant roles into a single, searchable, and mathematically rigorous platform.

## 🏛️ Core Pillars

### 1. Quantitative Finance & Math
Deep dives into the mathematical foundations of the industry.
* **Probability & Statistics**: Combinatorics, Markov Chains, and Bayesian inference.
* **Stochastic Calculus**: Itô's Lemma, Black-Scholes derivations, and SDEs.
* **Linear Algebra**: Eigen-decomposition and its applications in Portfolio Theory.
* **Brainteasers**: Logic puzzles and recursive games often found in prop trading interviews.

### 2. Algorithmic Mastery (LeetCode)
Optimal solutions to classic and modern algorithmic challenges.
* **Complexity**: Analysis of Time and Space complexity for every solution.
* **Patterns**: Grouping problems by technique (Sliding Window, DP, Monotonic Stack).
* **Quant-Specific Coding**: C++ memory management and Python performance optimization.

## 🛠️ Built for Rigor

To ensure clarity and precision, this site utilizes:
* **JetBrains Mono**: For maximum code readability.
* **LaTeX (KaTeX)**: For beautiful, accurate mathematical notation (e.g., $d S_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t d W_t$).
* **Structured Logic**: Each entry follows a "Problem -> Intuition -> Proof -> Implementation" workflow.
